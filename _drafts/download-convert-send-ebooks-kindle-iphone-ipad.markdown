“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies ... The man who never reads lives only one.” (George R.R. Martin)
I'm a big reader, and ever since I got a Kindle I've started reading a ton more "old" books, for two main reasons. One, the stuff I'm reading has usually stood the test of time, and two, much of it is legally and freely available. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) is great for finding material with no copyright, however sometimes the file format can be difficult.
