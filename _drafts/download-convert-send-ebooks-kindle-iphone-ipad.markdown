“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies ... The man who never reads lives only one.” (George R.R. Martin)

I'm a big reader, and ever since I got a Kindle I've started reading a ton more "old" books, for two main reasons. One, the stuff I'm reading has usually stood the test of time, and two, much of it is legally and freely available. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) is great for finding material with no copyright, however sometimes the file format can be difficult. Sometimes I buy books from places other than Amazon as well (such as [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/)), but of course the formats don't play nice. So, what can we do?

The most common recommendation I found when I was getting started was an incredible desktop software program called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It's not too pretty, but it works really well once you've got it set up. This was my go-to for a couple of years, before I got tired of having to manage everything on the computer. It was time to find a mobile solution.

Enter [Workflow](https://workflow.is/). For those of you who don't know, Workflow is basically a visual programming language (no, don't let that scare you). It lets you create "workflows" to complete multi-step tasks in a single tap.

As you can see above, there are a wide variety of different things you can do.

Now, onto the meat of the post. What do you need?
* Kindle
* iOS Device
* [Workflow](https://workflow.is/) App
* Email Account
* [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/) Free Account

Lets get started!
