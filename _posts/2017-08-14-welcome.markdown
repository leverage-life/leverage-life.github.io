Hey y'all.

So this is the start of a brand new type of blog for me - I've blogged about a few other things before, and saw that there is some (but not nearly enough) information on all different sorts of things relating to smart homes, home automation, and automation/integration of digital services and life.

I've got a few posts planned out which I'll keep secret for now, but I thought it'd be good to go over some of the technology I'll mainly be covering.

I'll be using iOS and MacOS (OSX) for most of the software side, so many of the apps and programs I might use are exclusive to those platforms.

For home automation, I use Philips Hue (& compatible lights/sensors/remotes), Google Home, Google WiFi, TP-Link, and a few other integrated plugs (either HomeKit or Google Home compatible products really).

On iOS, I'm a huge app fan, so I'll get into all of that later, but we will be seeing some integration with workflow (okay - there is a hint at what's coming, I lied).

That's all for now - the first real post should be coming in a day or so!
